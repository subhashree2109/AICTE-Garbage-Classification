# AICTE-Garbage-Classification
In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated garbage classification system leveraging the EfficientNetV2B2 architecture. Our primary dataset serves as a foundation for building models that can eventually automate waste segregation, a critical step in optimizing recycling and waste management, ultimately aiding in environmental conservation.
